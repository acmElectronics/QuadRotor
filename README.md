# QuadRotor

Goal is to build an autonomous Quadrotor capable of making decision itself. Decision logic will be based on sensor data and vision data. We will be using Arduino for configuring all the sensor and control data.
Quadrotor project for the tenure 2018-19. This repository is to maintain and manage all the codes, schematics and designs for the poject.
